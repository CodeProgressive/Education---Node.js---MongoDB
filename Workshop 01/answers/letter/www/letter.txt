Dear Jimmy and Ricardo,

Thank you very much for all your workshops about Node.JS and MongoDB. Your expertise in programming, databases, presenting and coordinating were greatly appreciated.

I really appreciate your help and I am sure I will be contacting you for your assistance when building my first Node.JS application.
When I find the time, I will be endorsing you on LinkedIn on Node.JS and MongoDB.

Best Regards,
